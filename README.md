# Web-Design-Challenge

# Opening Website
On the project repository there is a box on the right that says "enviornments", click on "github-pages" to access the website. Alternatively, you can click this link here: https://slquevedo.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/.

# Purpose
In this challenge we used OpenWeatherMaps API to gather weather data from 500+ cities. We then compared the cities' latitude to max temperature, wind speed, cloudiness and humidity to see if there was any correlation. More information about the methodology can be found here https://github.com/SLQuevedo/python-api-challenge. 

# Website Map
Clicking on the "LATITUDE" in the top left corner will direct you back to the homepage. On the right of the navigation bar there are 4 buttons, plots, data, comparison and repo. By clicking "plots" a list will drop down with what we compared the latitude. Clicking on, for example, humidity will redirect you to a page that has a picture of our lat vs humidity graph as well as what we discovered. These pages can also be navigated to by clicking the graphs on the "VISUALIZATIONS" box in the main part of the website. 

The data button will redirect you to a page where you can view all of the data that we used in the form of a table. 

The comparison button will redirect you to a page where all of the graphs are shown all at once. You may click any graph to be redirected to the corresponding findings page. It works similar to the "VISUALIZATIONS" box on the main page.

Lastly, the Repo button redirects you to my github repository where you can see my other projects.

On mobile devices or smaller screens the navigation bar will collapse into a hamburger menu. Clicking on the menu will reveal the same buttons as I mentioned previously.
